config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  'ondemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
	  The governor does a periodic polling and 
	  changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.

	  transitions).

	  'interactive' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor
	  designed for latency-sensitive workloads.

	  This governor attempts to reduce the latency of clock
	  increases so that the system is more responsive to
	  interactive workloads.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE
	tristate "'conservative' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand'
	  governor both in its source code and its purpose, the difference is
	  its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered
	  environment.  The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased
	  rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.

	  If you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering
	  the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop,
	  PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable
	  step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency
	  transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_conservative.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_NIGHTMARE

	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'nightmare' - a PegasusQ modified, less aggressive and more stable.
	  A good compromise between performance and battery. In addition to the
	  SoD is a prevention because it usually does not hotplug.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_DARKNESS
	tristate "'darkness' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'darkness' - based on nightmare but more simple and fast, basic configs
	  but very complex structure. It is an updated nightmare gov and improved
	  stability, so far it is quite stable in tests

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_ALUCARD
	tristate "'alucard' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'alucard' - a favourite choice and one of the original governors that
	  Alucard_24 made. Alucard is based on ondemand but has been heavily
	  tweaked to bring better battery life and performance. It has been known
	  to be battery friendly without sacrificing much performance.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_HYPER
